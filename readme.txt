Fork:

About:
	GrannySmithOS is an all-purpose shell for the CE calculator, which includes convenient
built-in utilities allowing the user to stay within the shell to accomplish anything they
wish. This shell adheres strictly to macOS Monterey design to the point of having a point-
less loading screen that just displays lines of the beautiful white color.

Instructions:
	1:	Open TI-ConnectCE. (Download from TI if you don't have one).
	2:	Connect your calculator to your PC.
	3: 	Open a Finder Window, locate and drag ALL .8xp files to the TI-Connect CE GUI.
	4:	Then follow the prompts to send it to the calc!

Navigation:
	-	Left, Right, Up, Down	– Move Cursor
	-	Enter					- Click/make a selection
	–	Clear					- Return to the TI-OS
	–	Prgm					– Opens Launchpad
	-	Y=					- Opens WordCE
	-	Window					- Opens Computer Algebra System
	-	Zoom					- Opens Algebra App
	-	Trace					- Opens Geometry App
	- 	Graph					- Opens Trigonometry App
